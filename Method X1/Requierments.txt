In this approach, I will adhere to the requirements outlined in the previous method (X0). 
However, I aim to consolidate two scripts, namely "Capture_for_5_seconds&send_to_CSV_Arduino.py" and "Capture_for_5_seconds&send_to_CSV".
To achieve this, the following implementations are needed:

-Creation of a generic function tasked with identifying the board in use (STM32 or Arduino) and returning a Serial object. This function
will facilitate dynamic data collection irrespective of the device in operation.

-Establishment of a procedure to configure the window length and initiate data capture.

-Enhancement of modularity by defining modules that will be implemented in a main script instead of separate scripts.

-Development of STM32 code to enable data streaming without requiring explicit requests for launching or blocking.

-For both boards the data is always streaming trought the UART port. The data capture (starting point)
is triggered on a specific user input (Here am using the space bare). This is ensured thanks to the keyboard library.   

-Enhance the Plot_CSVs.py script to include Gyroscope data (Gx,Gy,Gz).   

PS: In this version, examples with the prefix v2 present the data plotted against the sample number.
