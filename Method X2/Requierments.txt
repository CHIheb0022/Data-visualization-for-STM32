This method use the code source provided by shawn as part of his workshops with edge impulse.
Here a link to the Github repository: https://github.com/edgeimpulse/tool-data-collection-csv/tree/main


This method provide the following functionalities: 
    Am adapting this code using a 2s window instead of 1s (200 samples with 10ms SAMPLING_PERIOD) 
    Data collection is triggered each 2s instead of 1s in the original version and an led is set high while
    samples are collected (for vizualization purpose to get correct motion examples)
    At the end of each example (200 samples) we set a white line. This line will be interpreted by the python script
    as the end of the CSV and the biggening of a new example. 
    The python script works as a CLI where we can set: 
        Port number : -p parameter 
        Baud rate : -b 
        Target folder : -d 
        Data label : -l

CSV Data Collection Example:
Collection of data collection examples that store raw data samples as comma-separated values (CSV) files to be uploaded to Edge Impulse.

For custom sensor and custom board data collection, the data forwarder is likely the easiest method. 
However, if you require the ability to trigger collection via hardware (e.g. physical button) or you want to 
trigger collection each 2s or you do not have a USB connection, the data forwarder will not work. 
Use the examples in this repository as a starting point for collecting data in .csv files.

CSV Filename:
Your CSV files can be named any way you like. You can always adjust labels in the Edge Impulse Studio.
However, if you would like the Studio to automatically read the label, you can prepend the label to the
front of the filename. For example: <label>.<unique-id>.csv
