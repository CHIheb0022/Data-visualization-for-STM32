I have realised that the sensor measurments in the examples collected using Method X2 are static.
Meaning that for all eamples let's say the left-right class the values are constant (they are changing from an example to another)
but in the one example we can not visualize any signal variation for all metrics (ax,ay,az,gx,gy,gz).
Here you can see the issue am describing:https://studio.edgeimpulse.com/studio/328375/acquisition/training?page=1   


In fact this is due to the copy pasted arduino code wich is specific to the LSM6N sensor's library. The LSM6N is the IMU
provided in the Arduino BLE Sense 33.


So in this method I have udapted the Arduino code to match the hardware am using MPU9025.

Changes will cover the Arduino_Sending_Data_Simplified.txt and the dataset_CSVs folder  

I have also udapted the Plot_CSVs script to the new CSV file format. 

Creating Folders for each classe and still manual. The folder path must be provided when runing the script.

Starting and Ending Examples should be removed (it contains sammples < 200). Since we are appending to the first and last csv files
examples that could be missing the first samples or the last samples.
Removal is ensured manualy (checking file size on KB and delet the files with minor size)

->We can resolve this issue using a script (merged to the one collecting the data or separetly) to check if we have 200 samples at each example.
